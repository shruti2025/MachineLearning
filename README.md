This project is done with MNIST dataset that has training set of  60,000 examples and test set of 10,000 examples.

neural network is used to train the model. Backpropagataion method is followed.

Achieved  an impressive 97.8% accuracy by analyzing the MNIST dataset.

The model accurately and rapidly predicts the digit based on real-time input, enhancing the precision to recognise handwrittten digits.
